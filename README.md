# Download ICEWS Data and Convert to a Dataframe

Here is some experimental python3 code to download raw ICEWS files, clean them in line with [this](https://github.com/openeventdata/text_to_CAMEO), and then, possibily, de-deduplicate and aggregate event counts.

Code is still experimental, and might be buggy. It needs a lot of commenting right now. You should probably spot check any results.

There's a blog post coming, at some point.

`/text_to_CAMEO-master` contains the original code from Phil Schrodt.
